    <h1>History of athletics</h1>
 <p>The word ATHLETICS was commonly utilised to depict athletic games – for example, sporting challenges dependent on human physical accomplishments. In the nineteenth century, the term athletics obtained a progressively thin definition in Europe and came to depict sports including focused running, walking, throwing, and jumping.

 </p>
 <p>Organised athletics are followed back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC. The standards and configuration of the modern occasions in athletics were characterised in Western Europe and North America in the nineteenth and mid-twentieth century and were then spread to different portions of the world. Most current top-level gatherings are directed by the International Association of Athletics Federations and its part leagues.</p>
 <p>Athletic competition was incorporated into the first Olympic Games in 1896, and it has been as one of the first competitions at the quadrennial multi-sport occasion from that point forward. Initially, for men just, the 1928 Olympics saw the presentation of ladies' events in the sports program. Athletics is a piece of the Paralympic Games since the debut Games in 1960.</p>
 <p>A universal administering body, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), was established in 1912; it embraced its present name, the International Association of Athletics Federations, in 2001. The IAAF built up independent outdoor World Championships in 1983.</p>

    <li>Accelerates College Readiness</li>
    <p>Whether one participates in a team sport like Football or an individual sport like Golf, an elite athletic program fosters the development of integral problem-solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills that will help students in college and throughout their personal lives.</p>
    <p>Student-athletes develop leadership skills as they grow to understand that other people depend on them. They learn self-discipline as they grow to understand their choices have consequences. Ask any varsity athlete, and they’ll tell you the consequences of missing a practice or showing up late. This lesson in accountability is invaluable and will help your child succeed later in life as they enter the job force.</p>
    <li>Enhances Academic Performance</li>
    <p>Student-athletes develop intrinsic motivation and strong work ethics that enhance academic performance in the classroom. Research indicates that students who participate in athletics receive higher grades, better test scores, and higher educational achievements.</p>
    <p>Through athletic participation, student athletes learn the importance of preparation and practice. Unwavering dedication to their craft is the difference between home runs and base hits, starting on the field or coming in off the bench. Student-athletes often see their efforts translate into better athletic performance. And this relationship between performance and practice transfers into the classroom. From their experience as student-athletes, your child will approach tests the same way they approach an important playoff game: with focus, preparation, and practice.</p>
    <li>Improves Health and Wellness</li>
    <p>As unhealthy nutrition and exercise habits fuel the obesity epidemic in the United States, it’s essential for your child to adopt an active mindset that prioritizes rigorous physical activity. Participation in athletics helps creates a strong foundation for fitness habits that last beyond graduation. When active lifestyle values are emphasized at an early age, students will likely continue to exercise and adopt healthy habits as they grow.</p>
