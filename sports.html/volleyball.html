    <h1>History of volleyball</h1>
    <img src="valleybjpj.jpeg"style="width:40%">
    <p>From its introduction in 1896 to the people of the local YMCA and Springfield College, volleyball has traveled all the way around the world.</p>

        <p>It has spread relatively organically through a variety of social coincidences and intentional introductions.</p>
        
            <p>The YMCA played a major role in the globalization of volleyball. The sport was spread to areas of YMCA influence in the early 1900s.</p>
        
                <p>Areas like Canada, Asia, and South America saw an influx of people playing volleyball around the turn of the 20th century.</p>
        
                    <p>Volleyball picked up in popularity quickly from there and spread to areas of the Caribbean and fully inundated South America.</p>
        
                        <p>In 1907, the Playground of America convention highlighted volleyball as one of the “most popular sports” of the time, and in 1913, volleyball was introduced to competition at the Far Eastern games.</p>
        
                            <p>Another significant impact on the global distribution of volleyball was the disbursement of U.S. military members throughout the world in late 1910s.</p>
        
                                <p>In 1919, around 16,000 service members were presented with volleyballs, and the game was spread to many nations at this time by those serving abroad.</p>
        
                                    <p>Fast forward to 1964 and volleyball makes its Olympics debut in Tokyo, Japan. A more modern ball was introduced by Japanese players.</p>
        
                                        <p>The 1960s were quite innovative for volleyball as the dink, bump, and block were all introduced to the game.</p>
        
                                            <p>In 1996, beach volleyball finds its way into the Olympics and the indoor game is streamlined.</p>
        
                                                <p>1996 marks the seismic increase in the global popularity of competitive volleyball.</p>
